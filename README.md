The problem
We want to build a utility to design ASCII trains of a given configuration.

Building a train
Types of cars
The locomotive
The almighty locomotive will always be at the head of the train. Itâ€™s tried, tested and for your convenience, static.

The passenger car
We should be able to specify the number of windows on the car. It is important that windows have a single space between them. We will specify a passenger car with the keywords p# where # is the number of windows on the car. Some examples of passenger cars are provided below.

The hopper car
We should be able to specify the length of the car and type of mineral. We will specify a hopper car with the keywords h#% where # is the length of the car and % is any single character. Some examples of hopper cars are provided below.

Wheels
A car will have wheels (oo) at the front and back. Wheels must have at least one space in between the front and back set and be offset by 1 space from the ends of the car. Below are some samples of invalid wheel configurations on a car.

Joining cars together
Cars are joint together by their trailing -. We drop the 1 and attach the next car. Make sure we leave the full trailing connector at the end of the train. It is possible for a locomotive to stand by itself without any cars. Below is an example of a complete train with configuration p4 p6 h10O.

What you need to do
Write a function in a language of your choosing that will print out ASCII trains based on the above configuration. The function should take a single string argument specifying the configuration (eg. "p5 h5# p2") and either print the ASCII train to console or an error detailing why the given configuration is invalid.
